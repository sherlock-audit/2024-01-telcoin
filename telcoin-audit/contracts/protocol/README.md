# Protocol

This contract pertains to the governance structure in a broader sense. Generally speaking, they will not be created with a specific 3rd party contract in mind, but may require specific Telcoin integrations.

## Contracts

### TelcoinDistributor

This allows a council to distribute TEL without using a snapshot vote or a multi-signature transaction through the associated Safe Wallet. By eliminating the need for active participation from all of the council members TEL may be moved passively approving a transaction. A council member needs to control an NFT representing their seat in order to access certain permissions.
